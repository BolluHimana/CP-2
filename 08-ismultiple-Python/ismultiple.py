# Write the function isMultiple that takes two int values m and n 
# and returns True if m is a multiple of n and False otherwise. 
# Note that 0 is a multiple of every integer including itself. 
# Also, you should make constructive use of the isFactor function you just wrote above.



def fun_ismultiple(m, n):
	return False # replace with your solution
