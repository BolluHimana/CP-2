// # fabricyards(inches)
// # Fabric must be purchased in whole yards, so purchasing just 1 inch 
// # of fabric requires purchasing 1 entire yard. With this in mind, 
// # write the function fabricYards(inches) that takes the number of 
// # inches of fabric desired, and returns the smallest number of whole 
// # yards of fabric that must be purchased.

// # fabricexcess(inches)
// # Write the function fabricExcess(inches) that takes the number of 
// # inches of fabric desired and returns the number of inches of excess 
// # fabric that must be purchased (as purchases must be in whole yards)
// # . Hint: you may want to use fabricYards, which you just wrote!
