# Write the function nthCarolPrime(n), which takes a non-negative int and returns the nth Carol Prime, 
# which is a prime number of the form ((2**k - 1)**2 - 2) for some value positive int k. For example, 
# if k equals 3, ((2**3 - 1)**2 -2) equals 47, which is prime, and so 47 is a Carol Prime. 
# The first several Carol primes are: 7, 47, 223, 959, 3967, 16127, 65023, 261119, 1046527,... As such, 
# nthCarolPrime(0) returns 7.
# Note: You must use a reasonably efficient approach that quickly works up to n==9, which 
# will return a 12-digit answer! In particular, this means you cannot just edit isPrime. 
# Hint: you may need to generate only Carol numbers, and then test those as you go 
# for primality (and you may need to think about that hint for a while for it to make sense!).
