// # Write the function nthUglyNumber that takes a non-negative int n and returns the nth Ugly Number. 
// # Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 
// # 9, 10, 12, 15 shows the few ugly numbers. By convention, nthUglyNumber(0) will give 1.
