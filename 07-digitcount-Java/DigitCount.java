//digitCount(n)[10pts]   
//Write the function digitCount(n) that takes a possibly-negative int and returns the number of digits in it.
//So, digitCount(12323) returns 5, digitCount(0) returns 1, and digitCount(-111) returns 3. One way you 
//could do this would be to return len(str(abs(n))), but you cannot do that, since you may not use strings 
//here! This can be solved with logarithms, but seeing as this is "loops week", you should instead simply 
//repeatedly remove the ones digit until you cannot.

	public int digitCount(int n) {
