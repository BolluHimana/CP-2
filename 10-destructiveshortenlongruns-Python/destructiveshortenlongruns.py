# Here we will rewrite the previous function to be destructive. This version must not just call the nondestructive 
# version from above and then clear and replace the values in the original list. Instead, you must traverse the list 
# once and make the changes to the list as you go. With that in mind, write the destructive function shortenLongRuns(
# L, k) that takes a list L and a positive integer k, and destructively modifies L by removing any values in L that 
# would otherwise produce a run of k consecutive equal values in L. 
# For example:
# L = [2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 3] 
# shortenLongRuns(L, 2)
# assert(L == [2, 3, 5, 3])
# And: 
# L = [2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 3]
# shortenLongRuns(L, 3)
# assert(L == [2, 3, 5, 5, 3])
