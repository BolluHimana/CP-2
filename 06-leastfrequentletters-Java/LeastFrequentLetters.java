// leastFrequentLetters(s) [20 pts]
// Write the function leastFrequentLetters(s), that takes a string s, and ignoring case (so "A" and "a" are treated 
// the same), returns a lowercase string containing the least-frequent alphabetic letters that occur in s, each 
// included only once in the result and then in alphabetic order. So:
// leastFrequentLetters("aDq efQ? FB'daf!!!") 
// returns "be". Note that digits, punctuation, and whitespace are not letters! Also note that seeing as we have not 
// yet covered lists, sets, maps, or efficiency, you are not expected to write the most efficient solution. Finally, 
// if s does not contain any alphabetic characters, the result should be the empty string ("")

public class LeastFrequentLetters {
	public String leastFrequentLetters(String s) {
		// Your code goes here
		return "";
	}
