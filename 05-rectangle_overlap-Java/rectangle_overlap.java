// # rectanglesOverlap(left1, top1, width1, height1, left2, top2, width2, height2)
// # A rectangle can be described by its left, top, width, and height. This function 
// # takes two rectangles described this way, and returns True if the rectangles 
// # overlap at all (even if just at a point), and False otherwise. 
// # Note: here we will represent coordinates the way they are usually represented in 
// # computer graphics, where (0,0) is at the left-top corner of the screen, and while 
// # the x-coordinate goes up while you head right, the y-coordinate goes up while you 
// # head down (so we say that "up is down")
