// Background: we can represent a polynomial as a list of its coefficients. For example, [2, 3, 0, 4] could represent 
// the polynomial 2x3 + 3x2 + 4. With this in mind, write the function multiplyPolynomials(p1, p2) which takes two 
// lists representing polynomials as just described, and returns a third list representing the polynomial which is 
// the product of the two. For example, multiplyPolynomials([2,0,3], [4,5]) represents the problem (2x**2 + 3)(4x + 
// 5), and:    (2x**2 + 3)(4x + 5) = 8x**3 + 10x**2 + 12x + 15
// And so this returns the list [8, 10, 12, 15].

public class MultiPolynomials {
	public int[] multiPolynomials(int[] p1, int[] p2) {
		// Your code goes here
		return new int[0];
	}
