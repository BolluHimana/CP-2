# Write the function nthLeftTruncatablePrime(n).
# A Left-truncatable prime is a prime which in a given base (say 10) does not contain 0 
# and which remains prime when the leading (left) digit is successively removed. 
# For example, 317 is left-truncatable prime since 317, 17 and 7 are all prime. 
# There are total 4260 left-truncatable primes.
# So nthLeftTruncatablePrime(0) retunearestKaprekarNumber(n)rns 2, and 
# nthLeftTruncatablePrime(10) returns 53.
