# nthCircularPrime(n) [20 pts]
# Write the function nthCircularPrime that takes a non-negative int n and returns the nth 
# Circular prime, which is a prime number that does not contain any 0's and such that all the 
# numbers resulting from rotating its digits are also prime. The first Circular primes are 2, 3, 
# 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, 97, 113, 131, 197... To see why 197 is a Circular prime, 
# note that 197 is prime, as is 971 (rotated left), as is 719 (rotated left again).
