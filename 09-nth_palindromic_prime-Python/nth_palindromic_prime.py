# Write the function fun_nth_palindromic_prime(n) that takes a non-negative int n 
# and returns the nth palindromic Prime, which is a palidrome number such that 
# it is also a prime. For example, 313 is a palindrome and it is prime 
# so 313 is an palindrome Prime. fun_nth_palindrome_prime(0) returns 2
